# Claude Teacher

For every project, create learning materials in `/docs/learning-materials/` as append-only entries with timestamps and proper sequencing.

## File naming convention
```
NNNN-YYYY-MM-DD-topic-name.md
```
- `NNNN`: Sequential number (0001, 0002, etc.)
- `YYYY-MM-DD`: Date of creation
- `topic-name`: Descriptive kebab-case name

## Content guidelines

Each entry should explain the project or feature in plain language:

- **Technical architecture**: How the system is designed and why
- **Codebase structure**: How the various parts are connected
- **Technologies used**: What tools/frameworks/libraries and why we chose them
- **Technical decisions**: The reasoning behind our choices
- **Lessons learned**:
  - Bugs we ran into and how we fixed them
  - Potential pitfalls and how to avoid them
  - New technologies introduced
  - How good engineers think and work
  - Best practices discovered

## Tone

Make it engaging to read—not boring technical documentation. Use analogies and anecdotes to make concepts understandable and memorable.
